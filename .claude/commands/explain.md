# Explain Code

Provide a clear, comprehensive explanation of the selected code or file.

## Structure

1. **What it does** (High-level purpose)
   - Primary responsibility
   - Role in the larger system
   - User-facing or internal functionality

2. **How it works** (Key mechanisms)
   - Core algorithms or logic flow
   - Important data structures
   - Key functions/methods and their interactions
   - State management approach

3. **Why it's designed this way**
   - Architectural decisions
   - Trade-offs made
   - Pattern or paradigm used (and why)
   - Performance or scalability considerations

4. **Dependencies and integration points**
   - External libraries used
   - Other components it interacts with
   - Data inputs and outputs
   - Events emitted or consumed

5. **Common usage patterns**
   - Typical use cases
   - Configuration options
   - Example code snippets
   - Common gotchas or pitfalls

## Context-Specific Details

**For Components**:
- Props/parameters and their purpose
- State management approach
- Lifecycle or rendering behavior

**For Functions**:
- Parameters and return values
- Side effects
- Error conditions

**For Classes/Structs**:
- Fields and their purpose
- Methods and their responsibilities
- Lifecycle and ownership (Rust)

**For Modules/Packages**:
- Public API surface
- Internal organization
- Relationship to other modules

Use diagrams, flowcharts, or examples where they add clarity.
