# Create a Git Commit

Please commit the current changes following these steps:

1. **Review changes**: Check git status and diff to understand what will be committed
2. **Analyze commit history**: Review recent commits to match the repository's commit message style and language
3. **Draft commit message**: Create a clear, concise commit message that:
   - Uses the same language (English, Japanese, etc.) as existing commits unless specifically instructed otherwise
   - Follows the repository's existing convention
   - Describes the "why" not just the "what"
   - Uses appropriate prefix (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, etc.) if the repo uses conventional commits
   - DO NOT WRITE Claude Code credit
4. **Stage and commit**: Add relevant files and create the commit

Important notes:
- DO NOT include any AI/assistant credits in the commit message
- Keep commit messages professional and consistent with the project's style
- If pre-commit hooks modify files, amend the commit appropriately
