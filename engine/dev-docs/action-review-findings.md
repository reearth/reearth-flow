# Action Review Findings

Phase 3 quality review of the 74 base actions against [action-standard.md](action-standard.md).

**How to use:**
- Fill each action with either `ActionName — OK` or the checklist format from §7 of the standard
- Phase 4 improvement PRs should reference this file and delete completed sections as fixes land
- File is deleted when all sections are cleared

**Global fix (applies to all base actions):**
- `ports` — all ports currently named `default` must be assessed and renamed (§4.2); not called out per-action below. Check the Rust implementation to confirm semantics before renaming: if the port carries the primary feature stream rename to `features`; if it is a catch-all for unmatched features consider `unfiltered` instead. Make the change in Rust, then regenerate the schema (`cargo make schema-base`). Do not treat this as a mechanical find-replace.

## Debug (5)

<!-- Session 1 -->

```
EchoProcessor
  name:    → "Echo Processor"
  desc:    not imperative — "Debug Echo Features to Logs"; suggest "Echo features to logs and pass them through unchanged."
  tags:    empty — `debug` duplicates category (§6); no other established vocabulary terms apply; consider proposing `logging`

EchoSink
  name:    → "Echo Sink"
  desc:    not imperative — identical to EchoProcessor; suggest "Echo features to logs and discard them."
  tags:    empty — same constraint as EchoProcessor

FeatureCounter
  name:    → "Feature Counter"
  params:  countStart — marked required but has a sensible default (0 or 1); should be optional with a schema default (§3.2)
           outputAttribute — title "Output Attribute" is generic; suggest "Count Attribute" (§3.3)
           ordering — `groupBy` (optional) is defined between two required params; once countStart is made optional, correct order: outputAttribute → countStart → groupBy (§3.5)
  tags:    empty — suggest ["aggregation", "attribute"]; `debug` duplicates category (§6)

NoopProcessor
  name:    → "Noop Processor"
  desc:    noun phrase — "No-Operation Pass-Through Processor"; suggest "Pass features through unchanged."
  tags:    empty — `debug` duplicates category (§6); no other established vocabulary terms apply

NoopSink
  name:    → "Noop Sink"
  desc:    noun phrase with parenthetical — "No-Operation Sink (Discard Features)"; suggest "Discard all incoming features."
  tags:    empty — same constraint as NoopProcessor
```

## Input (10)

<!-- Session 2 — FeatureCityGmlReader reviewed in Session 6; original plan had it in Feature/Flow but current schema has Input category -->

```
CityGmlReader
  name:    → "CityGML Reader"
  params:  flatten — missing title and description (§3.3)
           dataset — description example "data.csv" copy-pasted from CsvReader; should
             reference a .gml file (§3.3)
           ordering — `flatten` sits between `dataset` and `inline`; correct order:
             dataset → inline → flatten (§3.5)

CsvReader
  name:    → "CSV Reader"
  desc:    title-case — "Read Features from CSV or TSV File"; suggest "Reads features
             from CSV and TSV files."
  params:  ordering — `format` is required but is 3rd in properties (after dataset,
             encoding); move to first (§3.5)
           encoding — description is paragraph-length; §3.3 prefers ≤2 sentences
           headerRows — description exceeds 2 sentences (§3.3)
  tags:    ["csv"] — 1 tag; suggest adding `file`

FeatureCreator
  name:    → "Feature Creator"
  desc:    title-case — "Generate Custom Features Using Scripts"; suggest "Creates
             features from a script expression that returns one or more attribute maps."
  params:  creator — description opens with imperative "Write a script expression…";
             should describe, not instruct; suggest "Script expression that returns a map
             (single feature) or an array of maps (multiple features)."
  tags:    empty — no fitting established vocabulary terms; consider proposing `scripting`

FilePathExtractor
  name:    → "File Path Extractor"
  tags:    ["file-system"] — not in established vocabulary; replace with `file`; 1 tag
             acceptable (no strong second candidate)

  params:  dataset — description example "data.csv" copy-pasted; should reference a
             .geojson file (§3.3)

             per-variant descriptions (§3.4)
           tileFormat enum variants ("png", "jpeg", "webp") — no per-variant descriptions
             (§3.4)
           10 params — exceeds 8; justification required (§3.5); batchSize looks like
             implementation leakage — evaluate removal (§3.5)
           ordering — alphabetical, not usability-ordered; suggest: dataset → readMode →
             layerName → attributeFilter → spatialFilter → includeMetadata → force2D →
             tileFormat → batchSize (§3.5)
  tags:    ["geopackage"] — 1 tag; suggest adding `vector` (and `raster` if tile reading
             is a primary use case)

JsonReader
  name:    → "JSON Reader"
  tags:    ["json"] — 1 tag; acceptable (no strong second candidate)

ShapefileReader
  name:    → "Shapefile Reader"
  params:  allowEmptyPath — description mentions "Rhai `()`"; remove implementation
             detail; suggest "If true, a null dataset path produces zero features instead
             of an error."
           encoding — description is paragraph-length; §3.3 prefers ≤2 sentences
           force2d — should be `force2D` per camelCase (§3.1)
           dataset — description example "data.csv" copy-pasted; should reference a .zip
             file (§3.3)
           ordering — allowEmptyPath (edge-case) is first; correct order: dataset →
             inline → encoding → force2D → allowEmptyPath (§3.5)
  tags:    ["shapefile"] — 1 tag; suggest adding `vector`

SqlReader
  name:    → "SQL Reader"
  desc:    title-case — "Read Features from SQL Database"; suggest "Reads features from
             a SQL database."
  tags:    ["database"] — 1 tag; acceptable (no strong second candidate)

FeatureCityGmlReader
  name:    → "Feature CityGML Reader"
  desc:    "Reads and processes features from CityGML files with optional flattening" —
             "reads and processes" is redundant; suggest "Reads CityGML features from a
             file path stored in the incoming feature, optionally flattening nested
             attributes."
  params:  ordering — required `dataset` is not first (codelistsPath is); correct order:
             dataset → flatten → codelistsPath (§3.5)
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note
           outputPorts `default` — global note

           attribute, elementsToExclude, elementsToMatch, source — all missing title and
             description within the oneOf variant (§3.3)
  ports:   inputPorts `default`, outputPorts `default` — global note; evaluate adding
             `rejected` for malformed XML (§4.3)
  tags:    ["xml"] — in vocabulary ✓

XMLValidator
  name:    → "XML Validator"
  desc:    "against XSD schemas" inaccurate for syntax/namespace modes; "with
             success/failure routing" references port behavior; suggest "Validates XML
             documents for syntax, namespace conformance, or XSD schema compliance."
  params:  schema title "XmlValidatorParam" — inconsistent casing; should be "XML
             Validator Parameters"
           schema-level description missing (§3.3)
           attribute, inputType, validationType — all missing title and description (§3.3)
           ValidationType enum ("syntax", "syntaxAndNamespace", "syntaxAndSchema") — no
             per-variant descriptions; plain enum type (§3.4)
           XmlInputType enum ("file", "text") — no per-variant descriptions; plain enum
             type (§3.4)
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `success`, `failed` ✓;
             evaluate adding `rejected` for parse errors (§4.3)
  tags:    ["xml", "validate"] — `validate` not in vocabulary; `validation` is; correct

  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `default` — global note

AreaCalculator
  name:    → "Area Calculator"
  params:  areaType — missing title (§3.3); description references "PlaneArea"/"SlopedArea" in
             PascalCase but actual enum values are camelCase (misleading)
           multiplier — missing title (§3.3)
           outputAttribute — missing title (§3.3)
           AreaType plain enum — no per-variant descriptions (§3.4); convert to oneOf or expand
             property description to describe each variant
  ports:   inputPorts `default`, outputPorts `default` — global note; no `rejected` — evaluate
             whether non-polygon features need a rejected route (§4.3)
  tags:    ["area", "measurement"] — neither in vocabulary; remove (0 tags acceptable)

BoundsExtractor
  name:    → "Bounds Extractor"
  desc:    title-case — "Extract Bounding Box Coordinates from Feature Geometry"; suggest
             "Extracts the bounding box coordinates of a feature's geometry and stores them as
             named attributes."
  params:  schema-level description missing (§3.3)
           ordering — alphabetical (xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin, zmax, zmin); suggest grouping by
             axis: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax (§3.5 readability)
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `default` + `rejected` ✓
  tags:    [] — suggest ["geometry"]

Bufferer
  desc:    title-case — "Create Buffer Around Features"; suggest "Creates a buffer polygon
             around each input geometry at a specified distance."
  params:  BufferType oneOf with a single `area2d` variant — incomplete design; other buffer
             types planned but unimplemented (same structural flag as XMLFragmenter)
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `default` + `rejected` ✓
  tags:    ["2d"] — not in vocabulary; replace with ["geometry"]

Clipper

             attribute."
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `default` — global note; no
             `rejected` — evaluate whether features lacking 3D geometry need a rejected route
             (§4.3)

Extruder

FootprintReplacer
  name:    → "Footprint Replacer"
  desc:    parenthetical "(supports solids, surfaces, and CityGML)" leaks implementation
             details; compound "Projects... and computes" obscures user-visible result; suggest

             each part as a separate feature."
  params:  GeometryPartType oneOf with a single `surface` variant — incomplete design; evaluate
             what other part types should be added (Phase 4)
  ports:   inputPorts `default` — global note; outputPorts `extracted`, `remaining`, `untouched`
             — semantics of `remaining` vs `untouched` need clarification in Phase 4 (both
             receive non-extracted features — are they distinct conditions?)
