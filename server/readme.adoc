== Getting Started

=== Build and Run Instructions

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before running the Go API server, you must first build the WebSocket server:

[source,bash]
----
cargo build --release
----
====

=== Running the Services

. Start the API Server (Required for Authentication)
+
[source,bash]
----
go run ./cmd/reearth-flow/

. Start the WebSocket Server

[source,bash]
----
cargo run

NOTE: The API server must be running first since it provides the authentication service required by the WebSocket server.
