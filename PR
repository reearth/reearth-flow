## Overview

This PR includes workflow updates and several engine improvements to output correct MVT tags.

## Changes

- MVTWriter now use `serde_json` instead of `bincode` for storing intermediate processing result.
  - bincode cannot encode AttributeValue which may contain `serde_json::Value` since [it does not store the type information](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/basic-custom-serde-logic-for-serialize-and-deserialize/112743/7)
  - generally MVT tile tags should not cause huge memory usage. MVTWriter is already using zlib compression so even memory becomes a problem in the future it can be easily solved by compression.
  - currently if `serde_json::Value` is used as any `AttributeValue`, a decoding error occurs which is hard to debug.
- CityGML attribute conversion refactored to align with reference implementation
  - previous logic was to flatten all arrays with one element, which is inconsistent with reference implementation and cause ambiguous object type. Currently single element array is only flattened for non-objects.
  - fix building quality checks and tests for the new conversion logic
- add temporary parameters to MVTWriter to replace colon and skip underscore prefix
- `gen:GenericAttribute` parsing in nusamai -> flow conversion
  - Previously generic attributes are converted to key-value map which is inconsistent with the reference implementation and drops type information.
- Add transportation data for PLATEAU attribute flattener
  - match proper feature_type and build schema for all visited feature_types
  - prevent huge hardcoded constants by migrating them to a `flatten_attributes.json` file
- Workflow updates for transportation
- Update plateau-gis-converter version
  - Measure stores arbitrary_precision strings. Previously nusamai-citygml parsed them as f64.
  - parse Measure uom and convert them to attributes with `_uom` suffix.
- Generalize date formatting to yyyy-mm-dd from only core:CreationDate (#1246) to all nusamai Date types.
- When constructing inner attribute json, a list of common attributes is extracted from the feature to match reference implementation.

## Todos

- Cesium3dtiles writer also uses `bincode` thus cannot handle number types.
- This PR is likely to break (already-broken?) bldg conversion workflow. It is better to implement a test framework before fixing it.
